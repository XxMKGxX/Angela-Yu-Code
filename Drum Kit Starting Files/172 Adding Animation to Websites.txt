Adding Animation To Websites.

--When clicking the keys of out drum kit, we would like for it to pop up to help the user know that they are clicking the right key.
--So the nice thing we could try is to create a function that has the parameter currentkey

    function buttonAnimation(currentKey) {

    }

--By doing this we can put this function inside our addEventListener by just calling it buttonAnimation(buttonInnerHTML)
--We do the same thing inside the keypress area but by putting event.key as its parameter.

--When we want to get a specific class for that specific drum letter we can just:
    document.querySelector(".w");
    //This will give out the w drum.
--Inside the code we want to make sure that we concantinate the current key
    i.e document.querySelector("." + currentKey)
--This will work i.e it shows the fact that you clicked a button.
--But we still need it to clear that box shadow after we have clicked or pressed the button.
--We can use the setTimeout() method to do so 
Example:
    function myFunction() {
        setTimeout(function) {alert("Hello"); }, 3000
    };
NOTE the 3000 is 3 seconds.
--What this does is that it shows an alert after 3 secods when a button with that function is clicked.
