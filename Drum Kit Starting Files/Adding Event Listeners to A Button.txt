--When making sure that our Javascript file is linked to our rest of project,
  we can use alerts to do so.
--But keep in mind that you use script with a=the attribute src in order to link that Javascript file.

// Button Click 
-- We createcd a function that helps us to see that the buttons work.
--We put a document.querySelector to target a button. Note that its the first button
--Then we add an Event Listener so that it can agree that the button was clicked and shows a result
--An Event Listener sets up a function to be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target i.e the document.
--It has 2 parameters which are clicks and function name
--Be aware that when using an event Listener, we do not want to call the function like we normally do.
--Rather we want to pass it in. That means we do not want to put () inside the event Listener.

//For Loop
for (var i = 0; i < document.querySelectorAll(".drum").length; i++)

    document.querySelectorAll(".drum")[i].addEventListener("click", handleClick)

function handleClick() {
    alert("I got clicked")
