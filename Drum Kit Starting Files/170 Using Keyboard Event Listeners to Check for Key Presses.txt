Using Keyboard Event Listeners to Check for Key Presses

--Since we have been using the click input for our Event Listener, now we want to use keydown for keyboard presses
--Be aware that they are in lowercases.

--By writing this code:
    document.addEventListener("keydown", function() {
        alert("key Was pressed!")
    });
  we will be able to set the page to be in contact with our keyboard press and lets us know that a key was pressed.

--Now in order for the keys to work we need an event inside the function parameter.
--Then we call in a function that can run that event paramter i.e makesound(event.key);
