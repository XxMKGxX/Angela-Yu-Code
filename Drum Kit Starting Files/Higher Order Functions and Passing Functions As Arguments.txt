--When it comes to customising HTML elements we can add an EvenListener to make a function that can operate on our localy saved file.
--For Example varname.addEventListener("click, function() {
    console.log("I got clicked)
})
--This sort of function is annonymus meaning it cant be called.
--Rather it just works on that specific line of code 
--EvenListener has 2 inputs, input 1 loooking for its given task and input 2 executing its given functionality.

//Calculator 
--to make a quick calculator we can do This

    function add(num1, num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    function multiply(num1, num2) {
        return num1 * num2;
    }

    function calculator(num1, num2, operator) {
        return operator(num1, num2);
    }

--Wht this operator input does is that it takes in the name of a function and puts it into work when the calculator function is called.
