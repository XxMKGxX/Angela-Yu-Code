What Is JQuery?

--This is known as the Javascript language that wil prevent us from breaking our fingers (lol).
--Javascript came to a point it got a lot of code written for a simple task to do.
--John Resick thought to himself that this was to complex for nothing.
--He is the man who introduced JQuery.
--Code that was too long to write would be shortened greatly.
    Example Code Of JQuery:
        $("button").click(function() {
            $("h1").css("color", "red");
        })
--Its a library that he wrote to use it to make our coding much easier.
--So from document.querySelector("h1") to this JQuery("h1")
--In the earlier example we noticed a $. That is the document.querySelector
