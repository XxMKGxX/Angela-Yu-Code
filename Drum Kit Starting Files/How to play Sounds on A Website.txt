-- We now want to play sounds on our website using Javascript. 
--We can try to implement this is by writing this code:
    var audio = new Audio('audio_file.mp3');
    audio.play();

--So what this new audio input does is it actually creates an <audio></audio> tag
--If we wanted to trigger the event listener we have to "this" identity in order for it to trigger a specific button
--To see this in action:
    function handleClick() {
    console.log(this)
}

--That way we can see in the console which button got triggered
--Step 1: We are looking for all of the elements inside the document that have the class drum
--Step 2: Once the loop has gone through the buttons, it has added an event listener to all the buttons.
--This is not just limited to just console log. We can also change the style of that clicked button
--i.e this.style.color = "white";
