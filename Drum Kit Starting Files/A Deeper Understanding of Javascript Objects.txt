A Deeper Understanding of Javascript Objects

--We can create properties inside our variables. 
--Example:
var bellBoy1 = {
    name: "Timmy",
    age: 19,
    hasWorkPermit: true,
    languages: ["French", "English"]
}
--bellBoy1 being the object and name being the property of the object
--i.e my name is + bellBoy1.name

--In order to shorten the code length we can make a factory that keeps on making bellboys
--This is known as a constructor function
--The name has to be capitalised its not camel casing

//Factory code:
    function BellBoy (name, age, hasWorkPermit, languages) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.hasWorkPermit = hasWorkPermit;
        this.languages = languages;
    }
--To initialise this object we say:
var bellBoy1 = new BellBoy("Timmy, 19, true, ["French", "English"]);
