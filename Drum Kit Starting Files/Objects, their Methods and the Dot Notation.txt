Objects, their Methods and the Dot Notation.

--Once we have created an object, we can give it a method.
--That way it can do something once we call it.
--To simplify it we can make put it under the var as an object e.g name (from the previuos lesson)


To illustrate:
    moveSuitcase: function() {
        alert("May I take Your Suitcase?");
        pickUpSuitcase();
        move();
    }

--This annonymous function works for a specific variable and cant work for other variables unless it is put in them.
--To call this method we just us .moveSuitcase(); to call that specific method.
--NOTE that the difference is that method have () whilst properties are just empty.
--To put it inside the constructor function we put as this.moveSuitcase.
