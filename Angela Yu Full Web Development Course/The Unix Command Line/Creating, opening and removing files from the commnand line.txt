//Creating a directory

--We start of with the command mkdir(make directory)
--Then we give that directory a name.It can be anything.
--if we want to create a file we use the touch command.
    Example:
        touch text2.txt
--Remember to specify the type of file(txt in the example.)
--To run it from the command line we use start text2.txt
--The cool is that we can specify the app we want to use to open that file.
-- We use start -a AppName text2.txt
--To remove a file we use rm(remove)
