Handling and Responding Responses:the GET Request.

--This server is the root of a website jsut like google.com
--Its the homepage of our server.
--Loading a website means a request has been sent to the server so that the browser can get access to that specific location.
--To resolve this issue we use the method get which has a parameter that states the location of our root(reperesented by a /)
--Once that has been done we create a callback function that tells the server what to do when that request has been made.
--This function takes in 2 parameters which are request and response
--We can see the result just by loging the request parameter.
--NOTE THAT: this method is put above the listen method. And when seeing changes makes sure to restart the server in order for it to work.
--The response parameter is given the job once the request parameter has been executed.
--So in the end we can type in response.send("Hello") inside the function in order for it to write back to us Hello
--We can send html as well instead of just text.
