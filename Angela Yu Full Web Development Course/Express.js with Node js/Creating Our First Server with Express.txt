Creating our first Server With Express

--We first of start off with creating project with npm i.e we initialise our project.
--npm init(done inside the command line.)
--To install express we check out its documentation(https://expressjs.com/)
--Like npm packages we can install it by stating npm install express
--This will make it as a dependancy for our project as well as inside the node modules.
--Once that is done we need to reqiure express.
    const express = reqiure("express");
    const app = express()//This is a function that represent the express module that uses the word app.
    app.listen(3000)//This tells it to listen to any http request sent to our server(3000 is the port)
--A port is a channel that we have tuned our server to.
--We can add a function to help us see that the server has started.
    app.listen(3000, function() {
        console.log("server has started on port 3000");
    });
--To open it in the browser we type in localhost:3000.
