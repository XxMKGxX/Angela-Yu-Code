What is Express?

--Express is a node framework.
--Like JQuery being a library for javascript to make it easier to use it, Express does the same thing for node.
--Think node as a regular screwdriver and Express as a motorised screwdriver.
--They both do the same thing but the mottorised is easier to use when having to screw in a lot of screws.
--It makes you write less repetative code on your web apps.
