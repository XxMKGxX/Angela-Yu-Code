--With the original route(the homepage "/"), It is used with the get method but we can have different routes for it.
--When it comes to making these routes we have to think ahead of time.
--If for example someone wants to contact us, we create a get method for that contact details page
    app.get("/contact", function(req, res){
        res.send("Contact Me at:");
    });

--Here is the install code:npm install -g nodemon
--once install we just need to type in nodemon javascript file name.js
