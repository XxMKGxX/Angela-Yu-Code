How to implement JQuery into a Website

--JQuery is a library like Bootstrap. 
--This means that we can use cdn to run that library on our website.

--Here is an example of code.
$("h1").css("color", "red");
-- The h1 color is being changed to red(that is its text color.)
--The position of the JQuery script tag is important. 
--Code is read from top to bottom. 
--So in order for the code to run make sure you place the tag is placed above the index.js
--Do not include it inside the head section of our HTML
