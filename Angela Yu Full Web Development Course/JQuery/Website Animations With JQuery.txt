Website Animations With JQuery.

--There are animations that can work on JQuery
    Example: 
        $("h1").hide();
--This will hide the h1 once a certain event has taken.
--The .hide method makes that possible.
--To make it reaper we can use the .show() method.
--There is also a toggle method that helps us to make it dissapear and reapear.
--Hiding it removes the element from the flow of code.
--To show a certain like animation we use the fadeOut method.
--This reduces the opacity and then dissapear.
--They also come with fadetoggle. This toggle with the aid of another html element when it has an event listener in place.
--When we want to use a certain method that can use css values, we use .animate method.
    Example:
        .animate({opacity: 0.5}); This is like a inline css type of thing.
--When using this method we can only use css rules with numeric value.
--We can make a chain of commands by adding a method after each one.(dont worry it wont do it all at the same time.)
--Never memorise use documentation.
