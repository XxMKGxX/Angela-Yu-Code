Manipulating Attributes with JQuery

--Attributes are the inisde of the html elements. 
Example src and href
--So in order for us to manipulate them with Javascript, we use attr method to do so.
    Example:
        $("img").attr("src");
--This gives us the value of the attribute but we can also set the value of the attribute.
    Example: 
        $("a").attr("href", "https://www.yahoo.com");
--This takes all the a tags and changes their links to yahoo.com
--Keep in mind that a class is also an html attribute.
