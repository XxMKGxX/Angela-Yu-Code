Selecting Elements with JQuery

--The $ does the same thing as the document.querySelector() were the contents inside the () can be selected as an element.
--This helps the code to be very specific. 
--When selecting css classes this can be done just by adding a . after the element to specify which element want to be selected for change.
--The $ also replaces document.querySelectorAll.
--Therefore there is not difference in selecting all or selecing one.
