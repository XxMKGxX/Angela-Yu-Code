Adding Event Listeners with JQuery

--It is simple to use event Listeners via the JQuery library
    Example: 
        $("h1").click(function(){
            $("h1").css("color", "purple");
        }); 
--This will turn the color of the h1 to purple once it has been clicked.
--We can change the color of the h1 with button by doing this:
    $("button").click(function() {
        $("h1").css("color", "purple");
    });
--This saves us from a very long list of code.
--We can have keypress inputs to take place as well.
    Example: 
            $("input").keypress(function() {
                console.log(event.key);
            });
--Thus showing us what key got pressed.
--If we do not want it to just focus on the input, we can just put document(without the "") in order for it to select the whole document.
--There are different kinds of events we can look for. Check the mdn Documentation.
