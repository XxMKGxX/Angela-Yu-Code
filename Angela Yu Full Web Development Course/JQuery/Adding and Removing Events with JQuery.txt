Adding and Removing Events with JQuery

--The cool thing about JQuery is that we can add new elements without having to chabge our code.
    Example:
        $("h1").before("<button>New</button>");
--This is creating a button before the H1 but its not in our code.
--Its inside the console for that specific page.
--Remember its the before and after methods that helps us to do that.
--We have prepend and append as well.
--To remove the elements we can just simply say .remove or rather use the remove method.
