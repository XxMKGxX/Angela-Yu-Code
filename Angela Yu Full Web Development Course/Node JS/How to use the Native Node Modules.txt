--We have the file system which helps to get access to the local files.
--In order for us to use this module, we need to require of it.
--We write this code: const fs = require('fs');
--The keyword const is different from var because this means the value of that specific constant cannot be changed.
--fs stands for file system.
--The use of the require statement allows us to use the modeule for now its the fs or file system module.
--The file system allows us to open, read, create files etc and the documentation gives us more on that.
--Through the methods given in the documentation: 
    fs.copyFileSync("file name", "destination file name")
--we just need to run the file(node index.js) and this will complete the task that has been given inside the js file.
