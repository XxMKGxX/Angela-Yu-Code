--We want to initialise the manager and this can be done by writing: npm init.
--This will run a wizard or a setup on the terminal.
--Once completed it will create package.json.
--Inside the file we will find what we wrote in that intallation process.
--The more packages we incorporate, their details will be found inside that file.
--To get these packages go to: npmjs.com
--The packages will give a description as well as its uses and related packages that you can give a go.
--Like the fs method we have to install it.
--To install it we write: npm install packagename
--Once installed it will apear on the json file as a dependancy.
