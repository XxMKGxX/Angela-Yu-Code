Understanding Templates vs Layouts.

--When submiting our new item it still goes back to the home route.
--This can be resolved by adding a dynamic value to the button in front of its name
--This will help us decifer if this itemis going inside our work list or to do list.
--Once seen we can make an if statement that has the key value involved.
    if (req.body.list === "Work") {
        workItems.push(item)
        res.redirect("work")
    } else {
        items.push(item);
        res.redirect("/")
    }
--Ejs allows us to create layouts were we can have certain text and css on multiple pages of our website.
--This can be implemented by putting headers and footers.
--This is the general loadout:
    <%- include('header'); -%>
    <h1>
        Title
    </h1>
    <p>
        My page
    </p>
    <%- include('footer'); -%>
