The Concept Of Scope in the Context Of Javascript.

--Scope is not only used in Javscript but also in different languages.
--Consider this code:
    function a {
        var x = 2;
        console.log(x);
    };
    console.log(x)
--The scope of var x is accesible to function meaning it can be changed inside not outside the curly braces of function a.
--These are known as local variables.
--Global var can be called inside or outside a function but they have to be located outside of any function.
--Here is the difference:
    Local variables are vars located inside a function and only work when called inside that function.
    Global variables are vars located outside a function that can be accessed and used inside that file.
--If a var is created inisde control flow code that var is global. It can be accessed.
--Unlike var, let and const are local vars inside that control flow code.
--In cinclusion it is best to use let and const wherever possible.
