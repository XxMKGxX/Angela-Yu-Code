--We would like to create an inout for the user in order for them to type in the city they are interested in.
--The url for our openweather map shortened to this:
    const query = "Harare";
    const appKey = "163659d072459ce0f09d45efb7800a50";
    const unit = "metric";
    const url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + query + "&appid=" + appKey + "&units=" + unit
--The data delivered by the user can be received when using body parser in this manner:
    app.post("/", function(req, res) {
        console.log(req.body.cityName)//cityName being an input from the html file form.
    });
--Once confirmed that data is recieved in the log we then put it as our query for the url.
