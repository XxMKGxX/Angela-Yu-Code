API Enpoints, Paths and Parameters.

--When using APIS think of 1. Paths
                           2. Endpoints
                           3. Parameters

--1. Endpoints: Everything that interacts with a server will have an Endpoint.
     Endpoints have url for us to get use.
     https://api.kanye.rest(This will provide random quotes by Kanye West)

--2. Paths:  Help us to narrow down to specific data for that API
     With a joke API we can customise the kind of jokes we wanna get back.
     different apis can have customisable options for the type of content we want.

     The endpoint is up to the last /
     The path is stated after the /
     This is done when are specifying a path for that particular endpoint.
     So the endpoint is the root and the parameter or path is the branch of that root.

--3. Parameters: Help us to narrow down to specific data for that API.
     These are normaly for finding a query that does not have a path.
     They come after the ? which is from the previous path.(?contains=debugging)
     debugging being the query and contains is the key of that path.
     we can have more than one query.
     the first query is after the ? then the next follow after the & symbol.
