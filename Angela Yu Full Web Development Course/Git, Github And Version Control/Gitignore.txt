Gitignore

--The whole objective of this command is to make sure we select the files we do not want to commit to the local or remote repositories.
--The basic files we use like settings family photos etc. can be pushed to our repositories.
--In order to make this gitignore file we us touch .gitignore(makesure to spell it correctly)
--To undo a mistake made inside the terminal we type in git rm --cached -r .(rm is remove; . is to select all)
--The gitignore file has rules such as # sign is used to comment out. 
--The * is used to say all the files with a certain extension i.e .txt will be ignored when committed.
--To add the files we make sure the spelling of the file names are the same as inside the gitignore file.
--NOTE THAT these haved to be put in each line like so: secrets.txt
                                                        file2.txt
