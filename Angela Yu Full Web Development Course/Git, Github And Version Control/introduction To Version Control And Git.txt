Introduction to Git and Version Control

--This module will show me the functions of GIT and Github's uses.
--We also will be learning how to use it in code and the command line.
--How to use version control, how to clone repositories, how to fork, pull requests and make repositories.
--Version Control: Code file with a few lines of code in it. Put it under Version Control using git and save points are created.
                   One day a savepoint is corrupt and its better to rollback to the prevous savepoint.
                   This can be done using GIT.
                   You can compare the savepoints
