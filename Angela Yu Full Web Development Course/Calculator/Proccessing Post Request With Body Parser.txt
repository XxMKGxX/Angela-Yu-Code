Proccessing Post Request With body parser.

--The Post Method found insid the form tag is allowing me to send the info somewhere.
--In order fo us to send this data to our homepage we can just remove the action attribute.
--The thing is that our server cannot send post in its current state.
--By adding the app.post method we can now give out a response that has been made when posted.
--At the moment the form data still is not being displayed even though the data has been posted.
--There is a npm package known as body parser that can help us with that.
--This will allow us to get access to certain variables and properties found inside our server.
--NOTE THAT we need to require this package in order for us to incorporate it.
--This can be used with express and it also has different modes(meaning different formats we can receive that data)
    const bodyparser = require("body-parser")
    const app = express()
    app.use(bodyparser.urlencoded({
        extended: true
    }))
--This is the code that is needed when using body parser.
--Now that this has been added we can create our calculator properly 
    app.post("/", function(req, res) {

    var num1 = req.body.num1;
    var num2 = req.body.num2;
    var result = num1 + num2;

    res.send("The result is " + result)
});
--To make sure its numeric we put in Number(req.body.num1);
--NOTE THAT bodyparser transfers it as text.
