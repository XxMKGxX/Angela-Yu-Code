React Props

--When it comes to adding html elements we have attributes that assist with the display of our website.
--For instance an Input element has attributes such as placeholder, value and ids.
--Bear in mind that these can also be used inside the HTML file as a seperate element from the div.
--Even though there are so many attributes, this does not give us the impression that we can create our own attributes.
--In the react world these custom attributes are known as properties.
